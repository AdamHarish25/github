/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Kivo Application
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model.  Each user's data is isolated under their UID.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user data is nested under `/users/{userId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data.
 * - Listing the entire `/users` collection is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Only authenticated users can create, read, update, or delete user documents.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `/users/{userId}` path inherently ties the document to the authenticated user's UID,
 *   avoiding the need for a separate ownership field within the document itself.  The `userId`
 *   path segment *is* the ownership field.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Not applicable in the current design, as only user-specific data is stored.

     * @principle Enforces document ownership for all operations. Validates path-based ownership.
