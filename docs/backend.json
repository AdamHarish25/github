The core principle is to ensure data isolation and security through path-based ownership. User data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, providing a natural and secure way to manage individual user profiles. This approach provides Authorization Independence, as access control can be directly tied to the `userId` without needing to query other documents. Since there is only user data, Structural Segregation is less applicable here."
